# PARALLEL COMPUTING
**Parallel execution increases the overall throughput of a program enabling to break down large tasks to accomplish them faster or to accomplish more task in a certain time. Web search engines that process millions of requests every second has parallel programming in it.**
**Parallel programming needs parallel hardware along with multiple processor to execute different parts of the program at the same time .**<hr>
# Flynn's Taxonomy
**Flynn's Taxonomy classifies parallel computer architecture on the basis of :**
> **1. Instruction Stream (control stream)**<br>
> **2. Data Stream** 

**Thereby classifying parallel computers into 4 parts:-**
> **1. Single Instruction Single Data.**<br>
> **2. Single Instruction Multiple Data.**<br>
> **3. Multiple Instruction Single Data.**<br>
> **4. Multiple Instruction Multiple Data.**<hr>
# Memory Architecture
**1. Shared Memory:- **
