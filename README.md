# PARALLEL COMPUTING
**Parallel execution increases the overall throughput of a program enabling to break down large tasks to accomplish them faster or to accomplish more task in a certain time. Web search engines that process millions of requests every second has parallel programming in it.**
**Parallel programming needs parallel hardware along with multiple processor to execute different parts of the program at the same time .**<hr>
# Flynn's Taxonomy
**Flynn's Taxonomy classifies parallel computer architecture on the basis of :**
> **1. Instruction Stream (control stream)**<br>
> **2. Data Stream** 

**Thereby classifying parallel computers into 4 parts:-**
> **1. Single Instruction Single Data.**<br>
> **2. Single Instruction Multiple Data.**<br>
> **3. Multiple Instruction Single Data.**<br>
> **4. Multiple Instruction Multiple Data.**<hr>
# Memory Architecture
**1. Shared Memory:-**<br>
**Here all processors access same memory with global address space. Change in the memory by one processor is visible to others. It is further classified into :-**
   > **1) UNIFORM MEMORY ACCESS**<br>
   > **2) NON-UNIFORM MEMORY ACCESS**<br> 
 
 **2. Distributive Memory Access:-**<br>
 **Here each processor has its own local memory , with its own address space.Each processor works independently.**<hr>
